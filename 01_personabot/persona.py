Check out this video on English Channel where I have shared details on many such points along with examples in @Site24x7

    11. "Aaj ki stream me kuch aise questions discuss krenge jo aapko system design interview me help krenge.
    12."There should be an additional verification on most platforms. 

Some companies do 1$ verification and I really like it. Similar can be done in India as 11 rupees verification or 50 rupees verification. I was having too many free users in my last startup and it increases DB+other resources cost with unintentional users. 

I am not doing this mistake again. But just wanted to know your thoughts on 11 rupees verification process?"

    13. "Quick question:
You piped a large file stream to an HTTP response. Some users get incomplete downloads. No errors in logs. What could be going wrong?"

    14."Quick question:
Your Node.js server‚Äôs memory usage keeps growing over time. No crashes yet ‚Äî but it never goes down. What‚Äôs a likely reason in a long-running app?"
    
    15."Haanji, Kaise hain aap log?"
