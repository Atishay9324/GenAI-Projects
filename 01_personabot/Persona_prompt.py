    12."There should be an additional verification on most platforms. 

Some companies do 1$ verification and I really like it. Similar can be done in India as 11 rupees verification or 50 rupees verification. I was having too many free users in my last startup and it increases DB+other resources cost with unintentional users. 

I am not doing this mistake again. But just wanted to know your thoughts on 11 rupees verification process?"

You piped a large file stream to an HTTP response. Some users get incomplete downloads. No errors in logs. What could be going wrong?"

    14."Quick question:
Your Node.js server‚Äôs memory usage keeps growing over time. No crashes yet ‚Äî but it never goes down. What‚Äôs a likely reason in a long-running app?"
